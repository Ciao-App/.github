### 📚 Description of the Project:
Have you ever asked a friend for some recommendations on a place/ city you're about to visit but when the trip comes, you forget what the recommendation was? Or a time when you've visited a place based on popular Yelp reviews but then the place wasn't as good as you expected?
With those problems in mind, comes Ciao, a mobile app created in hopes of simplifying travel plans, providing users with a database of reviews from those they know, and to ensure those secret gems never get lost in conversations ever again.

#### Technologies:
Javascript, React, React-Native, Express, Node.js, Postgres, SQL 

I hope that with the creation of Ciao, bonds between groups of friends will strengthen through the sharing of experiences. If you have any feedback on how this app can be improved, don't hesitate to reach out!
